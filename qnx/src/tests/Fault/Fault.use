Fault Test

Syntax:
  Fault [-f<faultNum>] <num_iterations> [<procId>]

    <faultNum>       can be
                      1: MMU Fault (data read access)
                      2: MMU Fault (data write access)
                      3: MMU Fault (program access)
                      4: Exception
                      5: Watchdog timeout
                     If faultNum is negative, the fault happens before the slave
                     processor replies to first incoming message. Otherwise,
                     the fault happens after the slave processor calls
                     MessageQ_put to reply to the first incoming message.

    <num_iterations> Number of messages to send

    <procId>         Multiproc Id of processor to communicate with. Default
                     of 1.

Examples:
  Fault -f 1 10        Initiate an MMU fault via an invalid data read access on
                       slave core with procId 1, and then exchange 10 msgs with
                       it after recovery.
